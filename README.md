# Activity Breakdowns

## Pattern Building / Recognition
Build patterns with blocks / cards / cars etc based on printed pattern instructions. Simple patterns / next-element prediction based on the current element only, more complex patterns based on previous 2, 3, 4 etc elements combined. Race to see which individual or team can get to a finish line with the correct last element. Define challanging patterns for other individuals or teams to follow. Bring in your own sets of identacle items / print-out images etc for use by the group. Use Claude to help define / predict patterns and ask clarifying questions.

## Human Logic Circuits
Use printed, specific instructions based on if / then scenario descriptions for each individual. Have one individual act as the architect arranging all the others as pieces. Split into teams to race and see who can pass the test for functioning logic circuits first. Use flags or raised hands etc to convey 1 / 0 status for individuals in circuit. Printed instructions should include all possible if / then scenarios as well as fill-in-the-blank areas to define the input individuals they should be looking at. Work with LLM to define instructions and ask clarifying questions during activity. Numbered shirts or marked number positions on floor may be used to identify who is who. Tape on floor may be used to visually show connections. Lights could be turned off or blindfolds used along with strings that are either tense (1) or lax (0) to test memorization of instructions as extra challange at the end. Try racing to complete working AND, OR, NOR and XOR circuits.
